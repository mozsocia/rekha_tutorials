Below are 10 new beginner-friendly questions designed to elicit Python code answers. Each question asks for a simple function with a function call, storing the return value in a variable, and printing the variable. The questions focus on basic operations to reinforce fundamental programming concepts for practice.

---

### Question 1: Halve and Add Three
Write Python code for a function that takes a number, divides it by 2, adds 3 to the result, and returns the final value. Call the function with input 8, store the result in a variable, and print the variable.

---

### Question 2: Check if Greater Than Zero
Write Python code for a function that checks if a number is greater than zero and returns `True` if it is, `False` otherwise. Call the function with input 5, store the result in a variable, and print the variable.

---

### Question 3: Multiply by Four
Write Python code for a function that takes a number, multiplies it by 4, and returns the result. Call the function with input 7, store the result in a variable, and print the variable.

---

### Question 4: Check if Divisible by Three
Write Python code for a function that checks if a number is divisible by 3 (i.e., no remainder when divided by 3) and returns `True` if it is, `False` otherwise. Call the function with input 9, store the result in a variable, and print the variable.

---

### Question 5: Square Minus Two
Write Python code for a function that takes a number, squares it, subtracts 2 from the result, and returns the final value. Call the function with input 4, store the result in a variable, and print the variable.

---

### Question 6: Add Three Numbers
Write Python code for a function that takes three numbers, adds them together, and returns the sum. Call the function with inputs 2, 3, and 5, store the result in a variable, and print the variable.

---

### Question 7: Check if Less Than Fifty
Write Python code for a function that checks if a number is less than 50 and returns `True` if it is, `False` otherwise. Call the function with input 45, store the result in a variable, and print the variable.

---

### Question 8: Double and Subtract One
Write Python code for a function that takes a number, doubles it, subtracts 1 from the result, and returns the final value. Call the function with input 6, store the result in a variable, and print the variable.

---

### Question 9: Minimum of Two Numbers
Write Python code for a function that takes two numbers and returns the smaller one. Call the function with inputs 15 and 10, store the result in a variable, and print the variable.

---

### Question 10: Multiply by Five and Add Ten
Write Python code for a function that takes a number, multiplies it by 5, adds 10 to the result, and returns the final value. Call the function with input 3, store the result in a variable, and print the variable.

---

### Instructions for Practice
- Write Python code for each question following the structure of a function definition, function call with the given inputs, storing the return value in a variable, and printing the variable.
- Ensure the Python code is clear and simple, using basic operations like arithmetic, comparisons, and conditionals.
- Assume inputs are valid (e.g., no division by zero or invalid types).
