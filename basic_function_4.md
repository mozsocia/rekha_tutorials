Below are 10 intermediate questions designed to elicit Python code answers requiring 2 or 3 functions to solve each problem. Each question asks for a solution with function calls, storing return values in variables, and printing the final result. The questions focus on combining multiple functions to reinforce modular programming and problem decomposition.

### Question 1: Area of Rectangle with Validation
Write Python code with two functions: one that validates if two numbers (length and width) are positive, returning `True` if both are, `False` otherwise; and another that calculates the area of a rectangle using length and width. Call the validation function with inputs 5 and 3, and if valid, call the area function, store the result in a variable, and print it. If invalid, print "Invalid dimensions".

### Question 2: Even Sum of Squares
Write Python code with two functions: one that checks if a number is even, returning `True` if it is, `False` otherwise; and another that squares a number. For inputs 4 and 3, check if each is even, square only the even numbers, sum the squares, store the result in a variable, and print it. If no numbers are even, print 0.

### Question 3: Discounted Price Calculator
Write Python code with three functions: one that calculates the discount amount (10% of price if price > 100, else 5%); another that checks if a price is valid (positive), returning `True` if it is, `False` otherwise; and a third that subtracts the discount from the price. For input price 150, validate it, calculate the discount, compute the final price, store it in a variable, and print it. If invalid, print "Invalid price".

### Question 4: Maximum of Three Numbers
Write Python code with two functions: one that finds the minimum of two numbers, and another that uses the minimum function to find the maximum of three numbers (hint: max = not the minimum of pairs). For inputs 7, 12, and 5, find the maximum, store it in a variable, and print it.

### Question 5: Temperature Conversion and Comfort
Write Python code with three functions: one that converts Celsius to Fahrenheit, another that checks if a Fahrenheit temperature is comfortable (between 60 and 80°F, inclusive), returning `True` if it is, `False` otherwise, and a third that combines these to process a Celsius input. For input 25°C, convert to Fahrenheit, check comfort, store the comfort status in a variable, and print it.

---

### Question 6: Positive Number Average
Write Python code with two functions: one that checks if a number is positive, returning `True` if it is, `False`; another that calculates the average of three numbers; and a third that filters positive numbers and computes their average. For inputs 10, -5, and 20, compute the average of positive numbers, store it in a variable, and print it. If no positive numbers, print "No positive numbers".

---

### Question 7: String Length and Vowel Count
Write Python code with two functions: one that counts vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in a string, and another that calculates the string length of a string. For input "hello", compute both the length and length, store the vowel count in a variable, and print it.

---

### Question 8: Triangle Area with Side Validation
Write Python code with three functions: one that validates if three sides (a, b, c) can form a triangle (sum of any two sides > third side), returning `True` if valid, `False` otherwise; another that calculates the semi-perimeter (s = (a+b+c)/2); and a third that calculates the triangle area using Heron's formula (√(s(s-a)(s-b)*(s-c))). For inputs 3, 4, and 5, validate the triangle, compute the area, store it in a variable, and print it. If invalid, print "Invalid triangle".

---

### Question 9: Odd Product Sum
Write Python code with two functions: one that checks if a number is odd, returning `True` if it is, `False` otherwise; another that another multiplies two numbers; numbers and a third that computes the product sum of odd numbers odd. For inputs 3`, 4, and `5`, compute the product of sum odd of numbers odd, store it in a variable, and print it. it If no odd, print numbers, print 1.

---

### Question 10: Circle Area and Circumference
Write Python code with three functions: one that validates if a radius is positive, returning `True` if it is, `False` otherwise; another one that calculates the area of a circle (πr²); and a third one that calculates the circumference (2πr). For input radius 5, validate it, compute both area and circumference, store the circumference in a variable, and print it. If invalid, print "Invalid radius".

### Instructions for Practice
- Write Python code for each question, defining 2 or 3 functions as specified, with function calls, storing return values in variables, and printing the final result.
- Ensure the Python code is modular, clear, clear, and uses basic operations like arithmetic, comparisons, conditionals, and simple string processing.
- Assume inputs are valid unless validation is explicitly required in the question.
- Use Python’s `math` module where needed (e.g., for π or square root).
